ALBUKHR Project Disclosure Standard
Project Market Framework — Version 1.0
Document ID: ALB-PMF-DSC-001
Version: 1.0
Status: Controlled Design Draft
Owner: ALBUKHR Investment Limited
Scope: Core, Internal/Contributor and External Projects
Network scope: Mainnet and Testnet, with strict network isolation
1. Purpose
The ALBUKHR Project Disclosure Standard defines the minimum information a project must provide to users before any project-specific staking or investment activity can be opened.
The purpose is to allow a user to understand:
what the project does;
why it is seeking Pi;
how much Pi it seeks;
how the Pi is intended to be used;
what stage the business is in;
what economic assumptions support the project;
what risks may affect the project;
what liquidity arrangements exist;
what staking terms apply;
how reward and capital withdrawal work; and
what happens when material conditions change.
Disclosure is an investor/user-protection control. Project approval does not mean that ALBUKHR guarantees the project's performance, profitability, reward payment or repayment outcome.
2. Disclosure Principle
A user must not be required to infer important economic or contractual conditions from marketing language, logos, short descriptions or scattered interface elements.
Material information must be presented in one coherent project disclosure package before the user confirms a staking/investment action.
The platform should distinguish clearly between:
Verified facts — information supported by evidence reviewed through the applicable process.
Project-provided information — information supplied by the project but not independently verified beyond the stated review scope.
Management assumptions — assumptions used by the project for planning or forecasting.
Forecasts/projections — forward-looking estimates that are not historical facts.
ALBUKHR system data — information generated from ALBUKHR records, such as status, term version, liquidity state or transaction state.
These categories must not be blended in a way that could make a forecast look like an actual result or a project claim look like an ALBUKHR guarantee.
3. No Investment Action Before Required Disclosure
A project must not be eligible for new staking/investment activity until its required disclosure package is complete and valid for the relevant term/version.
At minimum, the readiness chain is:
Project Approval → Funding Profile → Capital Plan → Risk Assessment → Liquidity Readiness → Staking Terms → Disclosure Package → Activation Readiness → Active
The frontend must not treat a project as investment-ready merely because status = approved.
The server/database must remain authoritative for readiness and eligibility.
4. Project Identity Disclosure
Every published project must provide a consistent identity record.
Required fields should include:
Project name
Project code
Slug/identifier where applicable
Project type: Core, Internal/Contributor or External
Network: Mainnet or Testnet
Business stage
Funding purpose
Project status
Logo
Owner/entity information where applicable
Verification status
Relevant registration/verification references where legally and operationally appropriate
The project code shown to the user must be the same canonical project identity used by the investment/staking backend.
A user-facing alias must not silently map to an unrelated project code.
5. Business Description
A project must explain in plain language:
what it produces or provides;
what customers or users it serves;
what business problem it addresses;
where it operates, where relevant;
its principal operating model; and
what makes the proposed activity economically relevant.
Marketing statements should be factual and proportionate. Claims such as “guaranteed success”, “risk-free”, “sure profit” or similar absolute assurances must not be used where they could mislead users.
6. Business Stage
The disclosure must show the project's business stage separately from its funding purpose.
Supported stages should include:
CONCEPT — business concept/planning stage;
SETUP — facility/equipment/operating setup;
PRE_OPERATION — substantial setup completed, commercial operation not yet established;
OPERATING — active business operations;
EXPANSION — operating business seeking growth capital;
MATURE — established business with relevant operating history seeking eligible additional capital.
A project may therefore display combinations such as:
Business stage: OPERATING
Funding purpose: EXPANSION
or:
Business stage: SETUP
Funding purpose: BUILD
This distinction is mandatory because the economic and execution risks are different.
7. Funding Purpose Disclosure
The project must state why it is requesting Pi.
The supported funding purposes may include:
BUILD — new business/facility;
GROW — existing business expansion;
OPERATE — working capital;
ASSET — productive equipment/asset;
BRANCH — new branch/location;
PRODUCT — new product/service;
RESTRUCTURE — eligible restructuring.
The user-facing disclosure must use a specific purpose rather than a generic statement such as “business development”.
8. Capital Requirement Disclosure
The project must disclose:
Funding target
Minimum funding target where applicable
Maximum funding target where applicable
Funding window
Total requested Pi
Current amount funded, where applicable
Remaining target, where applicable
Intended use of funds
Capital deployment plan
Required reserve
Required investor-liquidity reserve
Key funding assumptions
The funding target must reconcile with the submitted capital plan.
9. Use-of-Funds Disclosure
The project must provide an itemized use-of-funds plan.
Example:
Use
Planned Pi
Disclosure Type
Machinery
45,000
Planned allocation
Facility setup
15,000
Planned allocation
Packaging equipment
10,000
Planned allocation
Initial raw materials
10,000
Planned allocation
Working capital
10,000
Planned allocation
Reserve
10,000
Planned allocation
Total
100,000

The example is illustrative only and is not an ALBUKHR-prescribed allocation.
Where the project is already operating, the disclosure should identify whether the funding is intended for expansion, replacement, working capital, inventory, branch development, technology or another specific purpose.
10. Before-Funding / Current-State Disclosure
For an operating or expanding business, the disclosure should present relevant current information, which may include:
Current production capacity
Average production/sales volume
Customer/user base where meaningful
Current operating locations
Operating history
Existing productive assets
Relevant current costs
Relevant current revenue or sales data where appropriate
Existing material obligations relevant to the project
For a new business, the disclosure must state clearly that the business is not yet commercially established and must not present projections as actual operating performance.
11. Post-Funding / Intended Outcome Disclosure
The project must explain what the requested capital is expected to change.
This may include:
production capacity;
distribution capacity;
number/location of outlets;
equipment or assets acquired;
expected operating date;
expected working-capital cycle;
expected customer reach; and
other material operational outcomes.
Forward-looking information must be labelled as an assumption, estimate or projection as applicable.
Projects must not present projected revenue, customer numbers or production as guaranteed outcomes.
12. Capital Deployment Timeline
The user-facing disclosure must state when and how funds are intended to be deployed.
Where applicable:
Funding Raised → Restricted/Held → Deployment Stage 1 → Deployment Stage 2 → Operational Use → Reconciliation
For projects with significant execution dependencies, milestone-based deployment may be required.
Examples of milestones:
equipment procurement;
delivery;
installation;
commissioning;
production start;
distribution start.
Material milestone changes must be reflected in the project's disclosure/update history.
13. Economic Model Disclosure
The project must explain the economic mechanism that is expected to support its operations and project obligations.
Depending on the project, this can include:
revenue sources;
pricing model;
production cycle;
sales cycle;
inventory cycle;
customer-payment cycle;
operating-cost structure;
capital turnover cycle; and
expansion assumptions.
For operating projects, historical/current evidence should be distinguished from projections.
For new projects, projected economics must be labelled as projections and the principal assumptions must be disclosed.
14. Liquidity Disclosure
Before staking/investment is opened, the project must publish the liquidity status recognized by the ALBUKHR system.
The user-facing page should distinguish, where applicable:
Eligible available liquidity
Required liquidity reserve
Upcoming eligible obligations
Liquidity coverage state
Whether new staking is open, restricted or paused
The user must not be shown a simple “project balance” as though the entire balance were available for withdrawal.
Project-owned liquidity, user-committed capital, reward reserve, escrowed/restricted funds and required liquidity must remain conceptually and technically separate.
15. Staking Terms Disclosure
Before confirmation, the user must see the exact term they are accepting.
Required term information:
Project identity
Term version
Duration
Minimum stake
Maximum stake, if applicable
Reward model
Published reward rate/amount
Capital maturity rule
Reward eligibility/claim rule
Early withdrawal rule
Fees or penalties, if applicable
Funding window
Effective date
Term status
The system must display the term version that is actually used by the transaction contract.
16. Contract Immutability
Once a user enters a staking/investment position, the project cannot silently rewrite the economic terms of that existing position.
The following must remain tied to the user's original position where contractually applicable:
duration;
reward;
principal/committed capital;
maturity;
withdrawal conditions;
applicable fee/penalty rules.
A new project term must be created as a new version for future users/positions.
The historical version must remain auditable.
17. Reward Disclosure
The interface must label reward information precisely.
Preferred structure:
Published staking reward: X% for Y days
or the applicable non-percentage reward formulation.
The interface must not state or imply that ALBUKHR guarantees the project reward unless a separate legally approved structure explicitly provides such a guarantee.
Required accompanying information should explain:
what the reward represents;
when it becomes eligible/claimable;
whether early withdrawal affects it;
whether the reward depends on a particular contract state; and
that the user's applicable term is the controlling term for the position.
18. Capital Withdrawal Disclosure
The user must see:
maturity date/condition;
whether full withdrawal is available;
whether partial withdrawal is available;
any waiting/settlement state;
applicable liquidity conditions; and
any other published contract condition.
The platform must distinguish capital from reward balances.
At maturity, the expected sequence is:
Locked → Matured → Eligible for Withdrawal → Settled
A UI balance must not imply “withdrawable” before the backend marks the position eligible.
19. Early Withdrawal Disclosure
If early withdrawal is supported, the user must understand the exact consequence before staking.
Possible approved models include:
A. Maturity Only
No early withdrawal.
B. Early Withdrawal With Published Consequence
Early exit is permitted under disclosed consequences such as reward forfeiture/recalculation or a disclosed fee/penalty, where legally and contractually permitted.
C. Partial Withdrawal
Only an eligible portion can be withdrawn before final maturity.
The project cannot introduce a new early-withdrawal rule after the user has entered a position unless the original contract explicitly provides the mechanism.
20. Risk Disclosure
Every project must present the risks that are material to its particular business and funding purpose.
At minimum, the user-facing disclosure should consider:
Business risk
Execution/setup risk
Financial risk
Liquidity risk
Operational risk
Governance/ownership risk
Market/demand risk
Fraud/abuse risk where applicable
Regulatory/legal risk where applicable
A risk label alone is insufficient. The user should also see a plain-language explanation of the principal risks.
For example:
Liquidity Risk: The project's ability to meet eligible user obligations depends on the liquidity available under its approved treasury structure. A liquidity restriction may affect the opening of new staking activity and other project operations.
The final language for legal/regulatory warnings must be reviewed before production publication.
21. Approval vs Guarantee
The disclosure must make clear that:
Approved does not mean:
guaranteed profitability;
guaranteed business success;
guaranteed reward payment;
guaranteed capital recovery; or
endorsement of the project's commercial claims.
Where a project displays “ALBUKHR Approved”, the UI should pair it with an explanation of what ALBUKHR approval actually covers.
Approval should describe the scope of the completed review, not communicate a broader guarantee.
22. Project-Type Disclosure Differences
22.1 Core
Core projects should disclose their Core governance context, treasury structure, funding purpose, liquidity readiness, applicable staking terms and project-specific risks.
22.2 Internal / Contributor
Internal projects should additionally disclose the relevant contributor/project relationship, ownership/management information where appropriate, contributor agreement status, project review status and applicable internal controls.
22.3 External
External projects should additionally disclose ownership/entity information, due-diligence scope, applicable escrow/custody structure, material third-party relationships and other external-project controls.
Where ALBUKHR or an intermediary handles investor funds for an external project, the legal/custodial structure must be established and approved before public activation.
23. Material Changes
A material change is a change that could reasonably affect the user's understanding of the project, its risk, its funding purpose, its liquidity or the terms of a future transaction.
Examples include:
funding target change;
material use-of-funds change;
material ownership/control change;
major business-model change;
material liquidity deterioration;
material risk change;
project suspension/restriction;
new staking-term version;
material delay in deployment or operation;
material regulatory/legal event.
Material changes must create an auditable event and must be reflected in the user-facing disclosure where required.
Existing positions must remain tied to their applicable contract version.
24. Disclosure Versioning
Every project disclosure package should have:
disclosure version;
effective date;
publication date;
last material update;
responsible project submission record;
review status;
applicable project/term version.
Historical disclosure versions must not be silently overwritten.
The system should preserve the disclosure state relevant to an existing position where that information is contractually or evidentially important.
25. User Confirmation Before Staking
Before the final staking/investment confirmation, the user should explicitly see and acknowledge the key terms.
The confirmation layer should include, as applicable:
project name/code;
funding purpose;
amount entered;
duration;
reward;
maturity;
withdrawal rule;
principal/capital condition;
key project risks;
liquidity state;
term version;
material warning/disclaimer.
The confirmation should make it clear that the user is accepting the displayed project-specific terms.
The acknowledgement event should be recorded with the relevant position/transaction metadata.
26. User-Facing Project Disclosure Layout
A recommended user flow is:
PROJECT OVERVIEW
→ What the project does
→ Business stage
→ Funding purpose
FUNDING
→ Funding target
→ Current funding
→ Use of funds
→ Deployment plan
ECONOMICS
→ Current/verified information
→ Historical information where applicable
→ Forecasts/assumptions
LIQUIDITY
→ Liquidity status
→ Required reserve
→ Upcoming obligations/coverage state
RISK
→ Principal risks
→ Project-specific risk explanations
STAKING TERM
→ Duration
→ Reward
→ Minimum/maximum
→ Maturity
→ Withdrawal rules
→ Term version
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
→ Approval scope
→ No guarantee statement
→ Legal/regulatory notices as applicable
CONFIRM
→ User acknowledgement
→ Transaction/payment flow
27. Technical Integrity Requirements
Disclosure must be generated from authoritative records where possible.
The frontend must not independently invent or calculate material project facts that should come from the backend.
Authoritative sources should include, as applicable:
project registry;
funding profile;
capital plan;
risk profile;
liquidity/treasury state;
staking term record/version;
project status;
audit/history records.
The backend must ensure that a user cannot confirm staking against:
an unpublished term;
an inactive term;
a mismatched project code;
a different network;
a suspended/restricted project when the activity is prohibited;
stale or conflicting project information.
28. Mainnet and Testnet
Disclosure data must be network-isolated.
Mainnet users must receive Mainnet project and term information.
Testnet users must receive Testnet information.
Testnet may mirror eligible project registry metadata for testing, but must not expose Mainnet user financial positions, staking balances, rewards or ledger obligations.
Any displayed network indicator must be consistent with the backend network boundary.
29. Prohibited Disclosure Practices
Projects must not:
hide material risk in inaccessible pages;
use misleading headlines to obscure material terms;
present forecasts as historical facts;
present approval as a profitability guarantee;
present project-owned liquidity as user-withdrawable liquidity;
omit material withdrawal conditions;
silently alter active terms;
fabricate business metrics;
advertise guaranteed/unrealistic returns where prohibited or misleading;
use false scarcity or manufactured demand to pressure users;
conceal material conflicts of interest;
publish materially inconsistent information across the project page and the staking confirmation.
30. Market Integrity
The disclosure layer should support a transparent project marketplace without becoming a promotional ranking engine.
Projects may be discoverable using neutral factual attributes such as:
project type;
business stage;
funding purpose;
status;
funding progress;
term duration;
disclosed reward;
liquidity state;
risk information.
The platform should avoid presenting an unsubstantiated “best project”, “safest project” or guaranteed-performance ranking.
31. Data Model Direction
The following entities are proposed as data sources for disclosure. They are design targets and do not authorize immediate schema changes.
project_funding_profiles
Funding purpose, business stage, target and funding window.
project_capital_plans
Itemized use-of-funds and deployment stages.
project_economic_profiles
Current/historical operating information and forward-looking assumptions.
project_liquidity_profiles
Required reserve, eligible liquidity and coverage data.
project_risk_profiles
Risk dimensions, assessment version and current status.
project_disclosures
User-facing disclosure content, version and review state.
project_staking_terms
Project-specific staking contract parameters.
project_staking_term_versions
Historical immutable term versions where separate version records are implemented.
These records should be linked through the canonical project_id rather than depending on human-readable project names.
32. Existing System Preservation
Introducing this standard must not break existing functioning project, staking, transaction or withdrawal systems.
In particular:
Existing user positions must remain intact.
Existing financial ledger records must remain intact.
Existing Mainnet/Testnet isolation must remain intact.
Existing Core/Internal/External governance separation must remain intact.
Existing Pi payment security controls must remain intact.
Existing audit records must remain intact.
Existing term records must not be rewritten simply to introduce disclosure.
Where a current implementation conflicts with this standard, engineering should first identify the exact dependency and design a versioned migration rather than directly mutating production records.
33. Regulatory and Platform Boundary
This document is an ALBUKHR product/technical disclosure standard. It is not legal advice and does not establish regulatory authorization.
Because the ALBUKHR model can involve public-facing project opportunities and staking/investment-like participation, the applicable Nigerian legal/regulatory classification must be reviewed before public Mainnet operation.
The Nigerian SEC currently publishes rules and registration requirements concerning crowdfunding and digital-asset-related activities and has publicly warned against unregistered online investment schemes and unrealistic or guaranteed returns. The applicable classification of ALBUKHR and each project structure must therefore be confirmed with qualified Nigerian counsel and, where necessary, the relevant regulator.
Pi Network states that developers using its developer tools are subject to its Developer Terms of Use. ALBUKHR implementation must remain within those applicable platform requirements.
34. Activation Readiness Requirement
A project must not be considered disclosure-ready merely because it has a project description.
At minimum, the system should require:
Identity complete
Business purpose complete
Business stage complete
Funding purpose complete
Capital requirement complete
Use-of-funds complete
Economic model complete
Risk disclosure complete
Liquidity disclosure complete
Staking terms complete
Withdrawal rules complete
Applicable legal/regulatory notices complete
Disclosure version assigned
Required review completed
Only after these checks should the disclosure component contribute a positive result to Project Market Activation Readiness.
35. Design Decisions Locked by This Version
User-facing disclosure is a mandatory market control.
Approval does not equal investment eligibility.
Project-specific staking terms must be shown before confirmation.
Existing positions remain tied to their applicable term version.
Business stage and funding purpose are separate.
New businesses and existing businesses must disclose different evidence appropriate to their stage.
Funding use must be itemized.
Forecasts must be distinguished from historical/current facts.
Liquidity must be displayed separately from total project balance.
Risk disclosure must be project-specific.
Material changes must be auditable and versioned.
Mainnet/Testnet disclosure data must remain isolated.
Core, Internal and External projects retain distinct governance controls.
Approval language must not imply an ALBUKHR guarantee.
No existing financial/staking records should be rewritten merely to introduce this standard.
36. Next Controlled Documents
The next coordinated documents are:
ALBUKHR Liquidity & Treasury Framework v1.0
ALBUKHR Staking Contract & Withdrawal Framework v1.0
ALBUKHR Project Market Activation Standard v1.0
The Risk Framework, Capital & Funding Model and this Disclosure Standard should be treated as the first three layers of the Project Market Framework.
